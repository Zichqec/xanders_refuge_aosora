	\s[0]Mortals accuse us of being unfeeling, sometimes. \s[11]But we feel plenty, \s[111]it's simply that mortal matters tend to be minuscule to us.

	\s[0]I think luck is at its best influencing things subtly. \s[11]Sure it can be loud and flashy, \s[111]but making the day-to-day a little more interesting is what it's really about,\w4 \s[11]and there's a lot you can do small-scale to achieve that.

	\s[0]Sometimes mortals underestimate @Tohmjir.\w8{br}\s[11]They associate him with feasting and drinking, and think his role is largely one of luxury and excess.

	\s[11]I would try to explain the realm of the gods to you, but it's rather beyond mortal comprehension. \s[130]There aren't words in your language for me to communicate it meaningfully, \s[30]and any mortals who have glimpsed the divine are forever changed.
