//ABOUT THE WORD GROUPS BELOW, I've actually slightly complicated them for the sake of being able to count how many entries they have on the aigraph! The easier way to write a word group is with a single function like this:
/*
function wordgroupname
{
	return Random.Select([
		"Item 1",
		"Item 2",
		"Item 3"
	]);
}
*/
//But here, I've split it into one function which outputs an array (which you can then use a counting method on), and another function which calls that array and randomly selects from it.
//It's a bit weird I'm sorryyyy, I just realized a way I could have full feature parity and I had to go for it...
