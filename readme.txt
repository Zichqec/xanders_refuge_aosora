A quick content note: this character is always smoking, and frequently references alcohol and abuse of alcohol. Don't use him as an example of how to treat your mortal body. Also, there are some mentions of violence and other bodily harm.

This is a port of my ghost "Xander's Refuge". He was originally written in YAYA, and this is a port to Aosora for testing and demonstration purposes!

You can use him to compare the implementation of various functions and events between the two SHIORI. Just keep in mind that my Aosora code is pretty clumsy; I think in a YAYA way, and this ghost was designed in a YAYA way, so I'm sure I am not using Aosora to its fullest extent!

There are a few small differences between this version and the YAYA version which I am aware of and have not yet been able to resolve.
1. The timer for changing poses between dialogues is slightly inaccurate sometimes.
2. The menu greetings and pose selection don't have nonoverlap.
3. There's no aigraph yet (but this only matters for me since it's dev info).

Any other differences you find between this version and the original YAYA version are a bug, please report them!


Original readme:

Xander's refuge is a ghost made based on the prompt "a ghost of an ancient deity that always seems tired, and is looking for a safe place to hide". He's an extremely simple and straightforward ghost, with a focus on having some interesting content and being a nice idle piece to have on your desktop.

There is a bit of a story you can learn about, but this is optional. If you want to see all of it, make sure to click on new names as you see them, and check back in his menu once in a while.
